Completed first task of my "WEB DEVELOPMENT INTERSHIP" Which was to develop A To-Do List Web Application.

# To-Do List Web Application

A simple To-Do List web application that allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end, and Node.js with Express on the back end for task management. 

## Features

- Add new tasks to the to-do list.
- Mark tasks as completed with a checkbox.
- Delete completed tasks or undo deleted tasks.
- Clean and responsive user interface for efficient task management.
